An experimental interpreter for a small programming language written in the Igbo language. The goal of this project is to explore compiler design concepts while promoting cultural preservation through the use of the Igbo language.

## Why Igbo?

Igbo is one of the major languages spoken in Nigeria. This project aims to provide a fun way to learn about interpreters while also celebrating the Igbo language.

## Installation

1. Ensure a C compiler (such as `gcc`) is installed.
2. Clone this repository and change into the directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
   cd igbo-programming-language
   ```
3. Build the interpreter using `make`:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   This creates an executable named `igbo`.

## Quick Start

Run one of the programs in the `examples/` folder:

```bash
./igbo examples/hello.igbo
```

which prints:

```text
Ndewo, uwa!
```

### More Examples

See the [examples](examples/) directory for additional sample programs written in the language.
