# Igbo Programming Language Interpreter

This project provides a minimal C codebase for experimenting with an Igbo-language programming language interpreter.  It now includes a lexer and a recursive descent parser capable of building an abstract syntax tree (AST).

## Building

Run `make` to compile the project. The resulting executable `igbo` can then be used to run future source files.
Running the compiled program currently demonstrates the lexer and parser by building an AST for a few example snippets.

## Directory Structure

- `src/` - C source and header files.
- `examples/` - Sample Igbo language programs.

## Examples

Example programs will be placed in the `examples/` directory.
